# zed-just

This extension provides support for [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) files in the [Zed](https://zed.dev) editor.

I scrapped this together with bits and bobs from other projects for other editors. I don't know how to write Tree Sitter queries and probably can't fix your issues.

I'm happy to accept pull requests to this repository and make releases as needed, but I don't use Just anymore. 
I've migrated to [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) which doubles as a tool installer and task runner. 
I've found Mise to be more capable and have much better documentation, both being areas Just was lacking, in my opinion.
