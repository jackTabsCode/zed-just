# zed-just

This extension provides support for [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) files in the [Zed](https://zed.dev) editor.

I scrapped this together with bits and bobs from other projects for other editors. I don't know how to write Tree Sitter queries and probably can't fix your issues.

I'm happy to accept pull requests to this repository and make releases as needed.
